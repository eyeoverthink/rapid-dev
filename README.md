# Universal Media Downloader (Test Environment)

This directory serves as a development and testing environment for our enhanced media downloader application. We're building this alongside the original app to implement improvements incrementally and maintain a stable fallback option.

## Purpose

This test environment allows us to:
1. Experiment with new features safely
2. Implement modern UI/UX improvements
3. Test additional platform support
4. Refine the architecture before implementing changes in the main app

## Current Features

- Modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Support for multiple platforms:
  - Video: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo, Reddit, Dailymotion, XVideos, XNXX
  - Audio: Spotify, Deezer

   - Implement unit tests
   - Code documentation
   - Performance optimization

## Relationship to Main App

This test environment serves as a staging ground for improvements that will eventually be merged into the main application. By developing features here first, we can:
- Test new implementations without risking the main application
- Get feedback on new features
- Refine the architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Contributing

When adding new features or making changes:
1. Test thoroughly in this environment first
2. Document any API or dependency changes
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Update this README with new features or changes
